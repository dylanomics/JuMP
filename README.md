# JuMP MLE
This repository is taken entirely from 
Tyler Ransom's [Julia repo](https://github.com/tyleransom/Julia/tree/master/JuMP/mlogit) 
under `~/JuMP/mlogit/`.
It is technically "forked", 
but updated with some syntax from a newer version of JuMP.
If you know Julia and Git, 
then you know why version changes don't make friendly pull requests
(Tyler's repo has an 
[extensive package list](https://github.com/tyleransom/Julia/blob/master/packages.jl))
