# JuMP MLE
This repository is taken entirely from 
Tyler Ransom's [Julia repo](https://github.com/tyleransom/Julia/tree/master/JuMP/mlogit) 
under `~/JuMP/mlogit/`.
It is technically "forked", 
but updated with some syntax from a newer version of JuMP.
If you know Julia and Git, 
then you know why syntax from version changes don't make for friendly pull requests
(Tyler's [repo](https://github.com/tyleransom/Julia/) 
is quite large and draws heavily on JuMP.
